Hi!
My name is Tanishqa and welcome to my GitHub!
It's a bit dry right now, though...
But don't worry! It'll be bright and sunny soon! 
Currently, I'm working on a couple of projects! I'm building a smart mirror using a Raspberry PI and also working on a website to introduce myself!
While you're here, though, you can look at my Woodland Project that I made in 3 days over the summer with a team!
Thank you for visiting!
